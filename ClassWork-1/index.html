    <h1>About https protocol</h1>
    <p><b>Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)</b> is an extension of the <b>Hypertext Transfer Protocol
<<<<<<< HEAD
    (HTTP)</b>. It is used for secure communication over a computer network, and is widely used on the
    Internet.[1][2] In HTTPS, the communication protocol is encrypted using <b>Transport Layer Security (TLS)</b>
     or, formerly, <b>Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)</b>. The protocol is therefore also referred to as HTTP over TLS,[3]
    or HTTP over SSL.
    <br>
    <br>
    The principal motivations for HTTPS are authentication of the accessed website, and protection of the privacy
    and integrity of the exchanged data while in transit. It protects against man-in-the-middle attacks, and the
    bidirectional encryption of communications between a client and server protects the communications against
    eavesdropping and tampering.[4][5] The authentication aspect of HTTPS requires a trusted third party to sign
    server-side digital certificates. This was historically an expensive operation, which meant fully authenticated
    HTTPS connections were usually found only on secured payment transaction services and other secured
     <span>corporate information systems on the World Wide Web. In 2016, a campaign by the Electronic Frontier
    Foundation with the support of web browser developers led to the protocol becoming more prevalent</span>.[6]
    HTTPS is now used more often by web users than the original non-secure HTTP, primarily to protect page
    authenticity on all types of websites; secure accounts; and to keep user communications, identity, and web
    browsing private.

        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <p>SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) encryption can be configured in two modes:
            simple and mutual. In simple mode, authentication is only performed by the server. The mutual version
            requires the user to install a personal client certificate in the web browser for user authentication.[31]
            In either case, the level of protection depends on the correctness of the implementation of the software and
            the cryptographic algorithms in use.
            <br>
            SSL/TLS does not prevent the indexing of the site by a web crawler, and in some cases the URI of the
            encrypted resource can be inferred by knowing only the intercepted request/response size.[32] This allows an
            attacker to have access to the plaintext (the publicly available static content), and the encrypted text
            (the encrypted version of the static content), permitting a cryptographic attack.
            <br>
            Because TLS operates at a protocol level below that of HTTP and has no knowledge of the higher-level
            protocols, TLS servers can only strictly present one certificate for a particular address and port
            combination.[33] In the past, this meant that it was not feasible to use name-based virtual hosting with
            HTTPS. A solution called Server Name Indication (SNI) exists, which sends the hostname to the server before
            encrypting the connection, although many old browsers do not support this extension. Support for SNI is
            available since Firefox 2, Opera 8, Apple Safari 2.1, Google Chrome 6, and Internet Explorer 7 on Windows
            Vista.[34][35][36]

        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>Netscape Communications created HTTPS in 1994 for its Netscape Navigator web browser.[42] Originally, HTTPS
        was used with the SSL protocol. As SSL evolved into Transport Layer Security (TLS), HTTPS was formally
        specified by RFC 2818 in May 2000. Google announced in February 2018 that its Chrome browser would mark HTTP
        sites as "Not Secure" after July 2018.[43] This move was to encourage website owners to implement HTTPS, as
        an effort to make the World Wide Web more secure.</p>
